    "It is sometimes desirable to selectively enhance the contrast in either dark (under-exposed) or bright (over-exposed) areas of the image. Linear stretching, though, would expand the contrast uniformly. However, a non-linear mapping, such as the Exponential Operator, can be deployed:\n",

    "\n",
    "The operator is also known as __gamma correction__, due to its widespread use to compensate for the exponential voltage-to-intensity mapping ($I=V^r$) of old CRT monitors (often  $r=2.2$, i.e. darkening), which can be compensated by brightening  the image ($r'=\\frac{1}{r}=0.45$) before displaying. \n",
